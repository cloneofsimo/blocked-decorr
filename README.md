# üß† Block-wise Decorrelation Layer Experiments

This repository contains experiments with block-wise decorrelation layers in neural networks, comparing them with batch normalization and plain architectures.

## üìù Description

This project implements a novel block-wise decorrelation layer that efficiently whitens neural network activations by operating on smaller feature blocks. While traditional whitening approaches like full decorrelation, our approach reduces computational complexity through block-wise processing while maintaining most of the benefits of decorrelation. This is similar to how Shampoo optimizer uses block-diagonal preconditioning matrices in parameter space during optimization.

### üî¨ Mathematical Details & Relationship to Shampoo

The block-wise decorrelation layer performs the following transformation:

        C --> D1[Block 1]

    end

```

Given input activations $x \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times D}$ where B is batch size and D is feature dimension:

1. Center the activations:
   $$\hat{x} = x - \mathbb{E}[x]$$

2. Partition features into blocks of size k and compute block-wise running covariance:
   $$\Sigma_t^{(i)} = (1-\alpha)\Sigma_{t-1}^{(i)} + \alpha\left(\frac{1}{B-1}\hat{x}_i^T\hat{x}_i\right)$$
   where $\alpha$ is momentum and $i$ indexes blocks.

3. Compute block-wise whitening transformation:
   $$W^{(i)} = (\Sigma^{(i)})^{-\frac{1}{2}} = Q^{(i)}(\Lambda^{(i)})^{-\frac{1}{2}}(Q^{(i)})^T$$
   where $Q^{(i)}\Lambda^{(i)}(Q^{(i)})^T$ is the eigendecomposition of $\Sigma^{(i)} + \epsilon I$

4. Apply block-wise transformation:
   $$y_i = W^{(i)}\hat{x}_i$$

5. Concatenate blocks:
   $$y = [y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_k]$$

Similar to Shampoo optimizer which uses block-diagonal preconditioning matrices, our approach reduces complexity from $O(D^3)$ to $O(D/k \cdot k^3)$ while maintaining most decorrelation benefits. However, while Shampoo applies this in parameter space during optimization, we operate directly on activations during forward propagation.

## üî¨ Test Cases & Validation

### Correlation Analysis

We validate the decorrelation layer using synthetic test cases with known correlation patterns:

```python
def generate_correlated_data(batch_size, num_features, correlation=0.7):
    """Generates data with controlled correlation structure"""
    mean = torch.zeros(num_features)
    cov = torch.full((num_features, num_features), correlation)
    cov.diagonal().fill_(1.0)
    return torch.distributions.MultivariateNormal(mean, cov).sample((batch_size,))
```

#### Input-Output Visualization

The effectiveness of the decorrelation layer can be seen through covariance matrix visualization:

<div align="center">
<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="contents/Input Covariance Matrix.png" width="400"/></td>
<td><img src="contents/Output Covariance Matrix.png" width="400"/></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><center>Input: High Correlation (œÅ=0.7)</center></td>
<td><center>Output: Decorrelated Features</center></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

The heatmaps demonstrate:
- **Input**: Strong off-diagonal correlations (œÅ=0.7) between features
- **Output**: Near-diagonal covariance matrix, indicating successful decorrelation
- **Block Structure**: Decorrelation is performed within blocks of size 64, visible in the output pattern

This validates that our layer effectively removes unwanted correlations while maintaining the block-wise processing efficiency.

## üìä Initial Results

### CIFAR-10

I gave this a shot on CIFAR-10 with a 3-layer MLP.

Not bad tbh!
